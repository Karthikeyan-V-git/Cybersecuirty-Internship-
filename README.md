# Cybersecurity Internship Program
## 🏢 Provided by: Srida IT Consulting and Services Pvt Ltd

📌 Welcome
This repository documents my journey through a multi-phase cybersecurity internship program designed to simulate real-world Security Operations Center (SOC) tasks.

🚀 I'm excited to dive deeper into the world of cybersecurity — exploring how logs tell a story, how threats are detected in real-time, and how powerful tools like SIEMs empower defenders.

🔐 Through this hands-on experience, I aim to sharpen my skills in log analysis, detection engineering, and security monitoring, while building a solid foundation for a career in the field.

I'm eager to learn, experiment, break, and secure — and this repo will track it all.

## 🧠 What is a SIEM and Why it Matters?

**SIEM** (Security Information and Event Management) is a solution that helps organizations detect, analyze, and respond to security threats by collecting logs and correlating events across systems.

### ✅ Real-World Use Cases:
- Centralized log collection and search
- Real-time alerting on suspicious activity
- Incident correlation across multiple systems
- Threat detection & forensic analysis
